function [Edge_list] = Adj2Edg(Adj_matrix)
%ADJ2EDG converts an Adjacency Matrix into an Edge List 
%   
%   ADJ2EDG(Adj_matrix,symmetric) converts Adj_matrix into an edge list 
%   Edge_list treating NaNs as non-edges. 
%
%   Examples:
%       [Edge_list] = Adj2Edg(Adj_matrix)
% 
%   Inputs:
%       Adj_matrix - nxn matrix, with NaN for non-edges
%       symmetric - 0 directed (default), 1 symmetric
%
%   Outputs:
%       Edge_list - mx3 matrix of (parent, child, weight)
%
