Important Variables:
  A - adjacency matrix
  E - edge list
  n - number of vertices
  k - number of groups/blocks/roles
  r - number of edge bundles
  m_E,m_N,m_M  - number of weighted edges, non-edges, and missing edges respectively. 
  dw_in(i) - the in-degree of weighted edges for vertex i
  dw_out(i) - the out-degree of weighted edges for vertex i
  
Important Structures:
  Model – a struct of Data, W_Distr, E_Distr, R_Struct, Para, Options structs
  Data – a struct for raw and formatted observed data
  W_Distr – a struct for the weight distribution in our WSBM
  E_Distr – a struct for the edge distribution in our WSBM
  R_Struct – a struct for the edge-bundle structure in our WSBM
  Para – a struct for the inferred parameters in our WSBM
  Options - a struct for the inference options settings
  Flags - a struct for algorithm convergence checks

W_Distr 
  Struct containing the following fields:
	name - string
	distr* - to generate data (func of nrow,ncol,theta)
	cdf* - cdf of continous functions (func of A,theta)
	tau_0 - 1 by t_w vector of prior parameters

  *-denotes inline functions

E_Distr 
  Struct with the same fields as W_Distr but for edge existence distributions
  Note that for DC-Poisson Distr, T{end} is a function of Data.Degree, and Predict is off by a factor depending on the end-vertices' Degree.
  
R_Struct
  Struct containing the following fields:  
	name - string 
	R - k by k matrix mapping to edge bundle (k by k -> r)
	r - number of edge bundles
	k - number of groups/blocks

Para 
  Struct containing the following fields:
	mu - k by n matrix, mu(z,i) = prob vertex i is in group z
	tau_w - r by t_w matrix, tau of W_Distr for each edge bundle
	tau_e - r by t_e matrix, tau of E_Distr for each edge bundle
	theta - r by dim(theta) matrix, estimate of Theta for each edge bundle
	predict_w - r by 1 vector of predicted weighted edge values
	predict_e - r by 1 vector of predicted edge-existence probabilities
	LogEvidence - Marginal Log-likelihood (aka Log-Evidence), a model selection criterion 
 
Options
  Struct containing the following fields:
	algtype - 'vb' or 'bp'
	alpha - scaling parameter between W_Distr and E_Distr(0.5 Default)

	mainMaxIter, mainTol - Max Iter and Tolerance of main loop
	muMaxIter, muTol - Max Iter and Tolerance of mu loop
	mexFile - boolean, 1 if mex files are complied and will be used.
    mu_0 - kxn matrix prior vector for vertex-label parameters(sums to 1)
