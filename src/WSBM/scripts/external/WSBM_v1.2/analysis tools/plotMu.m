function [] = plotMu(Model)
%PLOTMU plots the posterior probability of vertex-label assignments. 
%
%   PLOTMU(Model) generates a IMAGESC plot of mu, the posterior probability
%   of vertex-label assigments. Each row is a vertex and each column is a
%   group. Ideally the posterior for each vertex is concentrated into one
%   group. If a vertex has a uniform or dispersed posterior, this indicates
%   a lack of fit or indecision in assigning a label.
%
%   Example:
%       [Label,Model] = wsbm(Raw_Data,k);
%       plotMu(Model)
%   Input:
%       mu   - kxn mat ~ mu(g,v) is the prob of vertex v belongs to group g
%   Output:
%       A IMAGESC plot.
