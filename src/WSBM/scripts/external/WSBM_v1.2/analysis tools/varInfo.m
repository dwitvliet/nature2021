function [vi] = varInfo(MU1,MU2)
%VARINFO calculates the variation of information (VI) between two 
%   vertex-labelings. For more on VI see:
%   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X06002016
%
%   Examples:
%       vi = varInfo(MU1,MU2);
%       vi = varInfo(Model1,Model2);
%       vi = varInfo(Model1.Para.mu,Model2.Para.mu);
%
%   Input:
%       MU1 - k1 x n ~ mu(g,v) is the prob of vertex v belongs to group g
%       MU2 - k2 x n ~ mu(g,v) is the prob of vertex v belongs to group g
%       Model1,Model2 - Model structs form WSBM
%   Output:
%       vi - a real valued metric of divergence between distribution 
%           Indentical Clusters <-> vi = 0
%
%       vi = H - I, where H is joint entropy and I is mutual information
