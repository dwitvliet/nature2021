%MAXIMALCLIQUES Find maximal cliques using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm
%   Given a graph's boolean adjacency matrix, A, find all maximal cliques 
%   on A using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm in a recursive manner.  The 
%   graph is required to be undirected and must contain no self-edges.

%   This script is adapted from Jeffery Wildman's script
%   (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30413-bron-kerbosch-maximal-clique-finding-algorithm),
%   implementing Adrian Wilder's suggested speed-up (a factor of > 200 speed up on my test data)

%   **For speed (e.g. I am using this as a subroutine on >1M small subgraphs), there is no input checking, use standard adjacency matrices (undirected, no loops) **

%   @input A, NxN boolean adjacency matrix
%   @output MC, K-length cell array of nodes adjacent in each of K maximal cliques on the graph.
